In a nutshell, this scans node_modules and builds an object that represents a basic dependency graph of locally installed packages. Rather than walking directories, this builds the tree by directly referencing dependencies listed in `package.json` of each project, which makes it pretty fast.

This only builds a tree of `dependencies`, e.g. not `devDependencies`, since those aren't installed for any modules other than the current project.

## What does it do!?

Allows you to easily get information from the package.json of any locally installed module.

**Example:**

```js
deps.get('fs-utils', 'version');
//=> '0.5.0'
```

Or use glob patterns:

```js
deps.get('*', 'homepage')
// =>
// { globby: 'https://github.com/sindresorhus/globby',
//  'is-relative': 'https://github.com/jonschlinkert/is-relative',
//  'is-absolute': 'https://github.com/jonschlinkert/is-absolute', ...}
```

If an object is returned with `null` values, this means that the package wasn't found at the given path. e.g. it was symlinked by npm.

To get around this, you can pass `{findup: true}` to the constructor and [findup-sync] will be used to find the nearest match. This is
disabled by default since this is an exception to the rule and it considerably slows down searches.
